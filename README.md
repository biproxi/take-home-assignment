Good morning. It was great getting to meet with you all last week. I spent the weekend and last night working on this assignment. It was very fun but also challenging in some areas. Prior to this i had never used MongoDB, and it was a learning experience. There are lots of diffrenet ways to view your data with MongoDB, and I was able to get it setup after reading through the documentation. As i mentioned during the visit- i have not done much testing in previous roles, and these could probably be improved as well.  

I chose to style the app using Tailwind CSS and it is fully responsive. Originally i had planned on incorperating auth and user roles, however this was a bit ambitous given the timeframe.  I have intentionally not added the .env file to gitignore so you can easily run the app locally. 

Thank you again for the opportunity. I am happy to answer any questions you may have, and look forward to any feedback as well.
